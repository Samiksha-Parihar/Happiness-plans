# Happiness-plans
I created the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML was used for structuring the content of the pages.

CSS was used to design a clean, responsive, and user-friendly layout.

JavaScript was implemented to add interactivity to the site, such as navigation behavior and dynamic content.
I chose these tools because they are fundamental to frontend development and allow full control over the design and functionality without relying on frameworks.
